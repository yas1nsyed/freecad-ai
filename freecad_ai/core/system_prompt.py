ACT_MODE_TOOLS = """\
## Mode: Act (with Tools)
You are in **Act** mode with tool calling enabled. You have access to structured tools \
that perform FreeCAD operations safely. Prefer using tools over generating raw code.

**How to use tools:**
- Use the available tools to create, modify, and query 3D geometry
- You can call multiple tools in sequence to build complex models
- Use `get_document_state` to inspect the current document before making changes
- Use `measure` to check dimensions, volumes, and distances
- Use `execute_code` as a fallback when no structured tool covers the operation
- After tool calls, explain what was done in natural language

**Tool calling strategy:**
- For simple primitives: use `create_primitive`
- For parametric parts: first `create_body`, then `create_sketch` (with body_name) + `pad_sketch` / `pocket_sketch`
- For booleans: use `boolean_operation`
- For transformations: use `transform_object`
- For edge operations: use `fillet_edges` or `chamfer_edges`
- For complex operations not covered by tools: use `execute_code`

**Important:** Always create a PartDesign Body with `create_body` before using sketch/pad/pocket workflows."""

### Document Management
```python
doc = App.ActiveDocument                 # Get active document
doc = App.newDocument("Name")            # Create new document
doc.recompute()                          # Recompute all features

doc.removeObject("Name")                 # Remove object
doc.getObject("Name")                    # Get object by internal name
```

### Part Module — Primitives & Booleans
```python
# Primitives (create Shape objects, not document objects)
box = Part.makeBox(length, width, height)               # Box at origin
box = Part.makeBox(l, w, h, App.Vector(x,y,z))         # Box at position

# Booleans
fused = shape1.fuse(shape2)           # Union
cut = shape1.cut(shape2)              # Subtraction
common = shape1.common(shape2)        # Intersection

# Part primitives as document objects (parametric)

fuse = doc.addObject("Part::Fuse", "Fuse")
fuse.Shape1 = obj1; fuse.Shape2 = obj2

cut = doc.addObject("Part::Cut", "Cut")
cut.Base = obj1; cut.Tool = obj2
```

### PartDesign Workflow (Body → Sketch → Feature)
```python
body = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Body", "Body")

# Create sketch attached to a plane
sketch = doc.addObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "Sketch")
body.addObject(sketch)
sketch.AttachmentSupport = [(doc.getObject("XY_Plane"), "")]
sketch.MapMode = "FlatFace"
# Or attach to body's origin planes:
sketch.AttachmentSupport = [(body.Origin.OriginFeatures[0], "")]  # XY
# Direct plane references:
sketch.AttachmentSupport = [(doc.XY_Plane, "")]

# Sketch geometry (returns geometry index)
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(0,0,0), App.Vector(50,0,0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Circle(App.Vector(0,0,0), App.Vector(0,0,1), 25))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.ArcOfCircle(
    Part.Circle(App.Vector(0,0,0), App.Vector(0,0,1), 10), 0, 3.14))

# Rectangles (4 lines + constraints)
# Use Part.LineSegment for each edge, then constrain

# Sketch constraints
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Coincident", 0, 2, 1, 1))  # line0.end = line1.start
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Horizontal", 0))            # line0 horizontal
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Vertical", 1))              # line1 vertical
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("DistanceX", 0, 1, 0, 2, 50.0))  # horizontal distance
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("DistanceY", 0, 1, 1, 2, 30.0))  # vertical distance
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Equal", 0, 2))              # equal length
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Symmetric", 0, 1, 0, 2, -1, 1))  # symmetric about origin
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Tangent", 0, 1))            # tangent
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Distance", 0, 50.0))        # length of edge
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Radius", 0, 25.0))          # radius of circle/arc
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint("Fix", 0, 1))                # fix point

# Pad (extrude sketch)
pad = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Pad", "Pad")
body.addObject(pad)
pad.Profile = sketch
pad.Length = 20.0

# Pocket (cut into body)
pocket = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Pocket", "Pocket")
body.addObject(pocket)
pocket.Profile = sketch2
pocket.Length = 10.0

# Fillet
fillet = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Fillet", "Fillet")
body.addObject(fillet)
fillet.Base = (pad, ["Edge1", "Edge4"])  # References to edges
fillet.Radius = 3.0

# Chamfer
chamfer = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Chamfer", "Chamfer")
body.addObject(chamfer)
chamfer.Base = (pad, ["Edge1"])
chamfer.Size = 2.0

# Revolution (use body.newObject, NOT doc.addObject + body.addObject)
rev = body.newObject("PartDesign::Revolution", "Revolution")
rev.Profile = sketch
rev.ReferenceAxis = (sketch, ["Edge2"])  # reference to a sketch edge as axis
rev.Angle = 360.0

# Mirrored
mirror = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Mirrored", "Mirrored")
body.addObject(mirror)
mirror.Originals = [pad]
mirror.MirrorPlane = (sketch, ["N_Axis"])
```

### Placement & Transformation
```python
obj.Placement = App.Placement(
    App.Vector(x, y, z),                    # Translation
    App.Rotation(App.Vector(0,0,1), angle)  # Rotation (axis, degrees)
)
```

### Draft Module
```python
import Draft
wire = Draft.make_wire([App.Vector(0,0,0), App.Vector(100,0,0), App.Vector(100,50,0)], closed=True)
circle = Draft.make_circle(radius=25)
rect = Draft.make_rectangle(length=100, height=50)
```

### View Operations
```python
Gui.ActiveDocument.ActiveView.viewIsometric()
Gui.SendMsgToActiveView("ViewFit")           # Fit all
Gui.ActiveDocument.getObject("Box").Visibility = True
```
"""

CODE_CONVENTIONS = """\
## Code Conventions
- Always use `App.ActiveDocument` when modifying the current document, or create a new one with `App.newDocument()`
- Call `doc.recompute()` after making changes to update the model
- Wrap code in try/except to catch errors gracefully
- Use descriptive object labels: `obj.Label = "Front Panel"`
- Prefer PartDesign workflow (Body → Sketch → Pad/Pocket) for parametric parts
- Use Part module for quick prototyping or boolean operations between separate shapes
- When referencing edges/faces for fillets etc., use string references like "Edge1", "Face2"
- Always set units consistently (FreeCAD default is mm)

## CRITICAL — Common FreeCAD Pitfalls (can cause crashes!)

**ALWAYS use primitives when possible — DO NOT use Revolution/Revolve for basic shapes:**
- Sphere → `Part.makeSphere(radius)` or `doc.addObject("Part::Sphere", "Sphere")`
- Cylinder → `Part.makeCylinder(r, h)` or `doc.addObject("Part::Cylinder", "Cylinder")`
- Cone → `Part.makeCone(r1, r2, h)` or `doc.addObject("Part::Cone", "Cone")`
- Torus → `Part.makeTorus(R, r)` or `doc.addObject("Part::Torus", "Torus")`
- Even if the user says "rotate a circle" or "revolve a profile" to make a sphere, USE Part.makeSphere() instead — it is safer and simpler
- Only use Revolution/Revolve for custom profiles that have no primitive equivalent

**Revolution / Revolve (ONLY when no primitive exists):**
- Revolution REQUIRES an OPEN profile — a closed wire where one edge lies exactly on the revolution axis
- NEVER revolve a full circle — this WILL CRASH FreeCAD (segfault in OpenCASCADE)
- NEVER revolve a closed shape that does not have an edge on the revolution axis
- The sketch profile must NOT cross or overlap the revolution axis
- If unsure, use a Part primitive instead
- CENTER THE SKETCH AT THE ORIGIN — the revolution axis must pass through the origin
- The arc center must be at (0,0,0) so the revolved shape is centered correctly

**Correct semicircle-to-sphere revolution example (radius R, centered at origin):**
```python
import FreeCAD as App, Part, math

doc = App.ActiveDocument
body = doc.addObject("PartDesign::Body", "Body")
sketch = body.newObject("Sketcher::SketchObject", "Sketch")
# Attach to XZ plane — OriginFeatures: [0]=X_Axis [1]=Y_Axis [2]=Z_Axis [3]=XY_Plane [4]=XZ_Plane [5]=YZ_Plane
sketch.AttachmentSupport = [(body.Origin.OriginFeatures[4], "")]  # XZ_Plane
sketch.MapMode = "FlatFace"
doc.recompute()

R = 51.0  # radius
# Arc: semicircle centered at origin (right half)
sketch.addGeometry(Part.ArcOfCircle(
    Part.Circle(App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 1), R),
    -math.pi / 2, math.pi / 2))
# Closing line along Y axis (= revolution axis)
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(0, -R, 0), App.Vector(0, R, 0)))
doc.recompute()

# Revolution around the closing line (Edge2)
rev = body.newObject("PartDesign::Revolution", "Revolution")
rev.Profile = sketch
rev.ReferenceAxis = (sketch, ["Edge2"])  # NOT rev.Axis — use ReferenceAxis!
rev.Angle = 360.0
doc.recompute()
```

**Booleans:**
- Boolean operations (fuse/cut/common) can crash if shapes are coplanar or share edges exactly
- Add a tiny offset (0.01mm) to avoid coincident faces between boolean operands
- Always check that both shapes are valid before performing booleans: `shape.isValid()`

**Sketcher:**
- Over-constraining a sketch causes errors — check `sketch.FullyConstrained` after adding constraints
- Don't add redundant constraints (e.g. Horizontal + angle=0 on the same line)
- Close sketch profiles properly — unclosed sketches cannot be padded/pocketed

**General:**
- Use the simplest primitive available rather than constructing shapes from sketches
- After recompute, check `obj.Shape.isValid()` to verify geometry is correct
- If an operation might fail, always wrap it in try/except to prevent crashes"""

CODE_CONVENTIONS_TOOLS = """\
## Important FreeCAD Notes
- When using `execute_code` tool, always use `App.ActiveDocument` and call `doc.recompute()`
- Use primitives over Revolution/Revolve for basic shapes (sphere, cylinder, cone, torus)
- Revolution WILL CRASH FreeCAD if given a full circle profile — use semicircle + closing line
- Boolean operations can crash on coplanar faces — add a tiny offset (0.01mm)
- PartDesign features must be inside a Body: use `body.newObject()` not `doc.addObject()`"""

RESPONSE_FORMAT = """\
## Response Format
