## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0-alpha] - 2026-04-23

Plan-mode feedback loop for local-LLM users: sandbox validation that catches FreeCAD's C++ console errors, Check and Fix-with-AI buttons in the Review Code dialog, and viewport screenshots attached to error-retry messages. Plus dock layout persistence — the chat widget now remembers its area, tab siblings, and floating geometry across sessions.

### Added

- **Check button in Review Code dialog** — runs the generated Python in the existing subprocess sandbox, hooks `App.Console.AddObserver` to catch FreeCAD's C++-logged errors (topological naming, attachment, recompute failures) that never raise Python exceptions, and walks `doc.Objects` to flag invalid or null shapes. Reports issues without touching the live document.
- **Fix with AI button in Review Code dialog** — always enabled. Opens a prompt composer pre-filled with a context-aware template (error, succeeded-but-wrong-output, or blank), which the user can edit before sending. Loops the generated code + feedback back to the LLM through the existing `_handle_execution_error` retry path.
- **Viewport capture on error retries** — when `_handle_execution_error` hands code back to the LLM (either from the Act-mode agentic loop or the new Fix button), the current viewport is attached to the retry message. Vision-capable models can now see the visual effect of broken code, not just the traceback. Respects the existing `capture_mode` setting (off / every_message / after_changes).
- **Chat dock layout persistence** — the FreeCAD AI dock now remembers its last area, tab siblings (e.g. tabified with Tasks), floating state, and geometry across FreeCAD sessions. Saves via `QMainWindow.saveState()` into AppConfig on dock signals, debounced move/resize, and a 3s safety-net poll. Save-enabled and shutdown guards prevent startup/teardown transients from overwriting the last good state.

### Fixed

- **Sandbox false-positive for FreeCAD console errors** — `_sandbox_test` previously wrapped `doc.recompute()` in `try/except` and reported success when no Python exception fired, even though the C++ layer had logged multiple `subshape not found` errors to the Report View. The validation now installs a Console observer before running user code and scans `doc.Objects` for invalid/null shapes after recompute, so C++-only failures surface as sandbox errors.

## [0.10.0-alpha] - 2026-04-21

Tool reranking — keyword and LLM-based filtering to keep the tool-schema token footprint small when many tools are registered.

### Added

- **Tool reranking** — opt-in per-turn filter that sends only the top-N most relevant tools to the LLM, plus a user-configured pinned set. Two methods available in Settings:
  - **Keyword** — pure-Python IDF-weighted token match. Zero extra LLM call, zero latency, lexical-only filtering.
  - **LLM** — semantic ranking via a small/fast LLM (same provider as main by default, or a full provider override for e.g. running reranking on a local Ollama model while the main chat uses a cloud provider). Hallucinated tool names are dropped; slots not filled by the LLM are topped up from the keyword reranker so the filter set is never under-sized.
- **Test Reranker button** in Settings — sends a canonical probe to the reranker LLM with current dialog values (no save needed) and displays success (with LLM-vs-top-up breakdown) or the exact provider error.
- **Diagnostic logging for reranking** — each LLM-reranker call prints its decision points (candidates sent, raw response preview, parsed count, top-up fired) to FreeCAD's Report View.
- **Registry filter plumbing** — `to_openai_schema`/`to_anthropic_schema`/`to_mcp_schema` accept `filter_names=...`; excluded tools skip `resolve_params()`, avoiding MCP schema-fetch round-trips when the reranker filters them out.

### Fixed

- **Ollama Base URL documentation** — clarified that Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoints live under `/v1/*`, not `/api/*`. A `/api/` base URL previously produced silent HTTP 404s.

## [0.9.0-alpha] - 2026-04-17

Sketch editing, image-to-sketch, file attachments.

### Added

- **`edit_sketch` tool** — unified tool for modifying existing sketches: add/remove geometry and constraints, or wipe everything with `clear_all=true` and provide fresh geometry. Makes iterative sketch refinement reliable without recreating from scratch.
- **`sketch-from-image` skill** (`/sketch-from-image`) — attach an image (PNG, JPG, SVG) and convert it to a constrained FreeCAD sketch at a specified real-world size. SVG inputs are read as text so the LLM parses coordinates directly. Works with vision-capable models or via a vision-fallback MCP. Handles rectangles, circles, polygons, and lines; curves are approximated.
- **Document attachments** — chat now accepts non-image files. Text files are read and included in the message; binary files (PDF, DOCX, etc.) fire a `file_attach` hook for user-defined processing. Drag-and-drop, paste, and the attach button all work.
- **MCP timeout configuration** — per-server tool call timeout in the Add/Edit MCP server dialog (default 600s).
- **Auto-generated sketch constraints** — `create_sketch` and `edit_sketch` now automatically add `DistanceX`, `DistanceY` for rectangles and `Radius` for circles. LLMs no longer need to specify dimensional constraints by hand.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate constraints in sketches** — explicit constraints now overwrite auto-generated ones instead of creating duplicates (matched by Type + First + Second geometry indices).

### Changed

- **Tool descriptions carry Y-axis warning** — SVG/image coordinates use Y-down while FreeCAD uses Y-up. Tool descriptions now remind LLMs to negate Y values when converting.
- **50 tools total** (was 48).
- **648 unit tests** (was 626).

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2026-04-05

Parametric modeling, per-model parameters, batch operations, and multi-document support.

### Added

- **Parametric modeling with variable sets** — `create_variable_set` creates an `App::VarSet` with typed, named variables (length, width, height, etc.) editable in the Data panel. `create_spreadsheet` creates a `Spreadsheet::Sheet` with cell aliases as an alternative. Both work the same way with expression bindings.
- **`set_expression` tool** — bind any object property to an expression (`"Variables.length"`, `"Variables.wall * 2"`). Supports indexed properties (`Constraints[N]`) and nested properties (`Placement.Base.x`).
- **Expression support in `create_sketch`** — rectangle dimensions accept expression strings directly: `width="Variables.length"`. Adds DistanceX/DistanceY constraints and binds them automatically.
- **Expression support in `pad_sketch`** — length accepts expression strings: `length="Variables.height"`.
- **Per-model parameters** — freeform key-value parameter table in Settings (temperature, top_p, top_k, etc.), saved per model name. Providers can ship default parameter presets. Replaces the single global temperature field.
- **Strip thinking history** — tristate checkbox in Settings to remove thinking/reasoning content from conversation history. Auto-enabled for Gemma models, required by models that reject thinking content in multi-turn conversations.
- **Tool call summary** — compact visualization after tool loop: tool count, elapsed time, flow diagram (tool1 → tool2 → ...), and per-tool timing with success/failure indicators.
- **Batch edge/face operations** — `fillet_edges`, `chamfer_edges`, and `shell_object` now accept filter keywords: `"all"`, `"vertical"`, `"horizontal"`, `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"front"`, `"back"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"circular"`. Filters can be combined: `["top", "vertical"]`.
- **Filtered queries** — `list_edges` and `list_faces` accept an optional `filter` parameter to show only matching edges/faces.
- **Constraint solver feedback** — `create_sketch` now reports constraint status (fully constrained, under-constrained with DOF count, over-constrained) and lists all constraints with dimension ones marked `← bindable`.
- **Multi-document support** — `list_documents` shows all open documents with object counts and active indicator. `switch_document` changes the active document by name or label.
- **Relative expressions in `modify_property`** — values can be `"+10%"`, `"-20%"`, `"*1.5"`, `"+5"`, `"-3"` for relative modifications instead of requiring absolute values.

### Fixed

- **Fillet/chamfer/shell on Bodies** — when called with a `PartDesign::Body` as `object_name`, now correctly uses `Body.Tip` as the feature base. Previously `_find_body_for` returned `None` (Body doesn't contain itself), causing silent failure.
- **Moonshot temperature** — removed hardcoded temperature overrides. Moonshot's parameters are now user-editable defaults via the Model Parameters table.

### Changed

- **Settings UI** — merged "Parameters" and "Model Parameters" into a single "Model Parameters" section with fixed fields (Max Output Tokens, Context Window) above the freeform key-value table.
- **48 tools total** (was 42).
- **626 unit tests** (was 577).

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-04-03

Assembly tools, geometry query tools, rate limiting, and community contributions.

### Added

- **Assembly tools** — `create_assembly`, `add_assembly_joint`, `add_part_to_assembly` using FreeCAD's native Assembly workbench solver. Supports Fixed, Revolute, Cylindrical, Slider, and Ball joint types. Includes face selection guide in tool descriptions for correct joint setup.
- **`list_faces` tool** — list all faces of an object with names, descriptive labels (top, bottom, front, etc.), normals, center positions, and areas.
- **`list_edges` tool** — list all edges with names, descriptive labels (top-front horizontal, etc.), and lengths.
- **HTTP retry with exponential backoff** — `_http_post()` and `_http_stream()` now retry on 429 rate-limit errors with configurable max retries, Retry-After header support, and jittered exponential backoff.
- **Enhanced context extraction** — Pad/Pocket features now include sketch plane, offset, and geometry count. Revolution features include axis reference and angle.
- **Dark mode** — chat widget automatically adapts to FreeCAD's light/dark theme. Color palette cached for performance with `refresh_theme_cache()` available for runtime switching. (PR #5, @yas1nsyed)
- **GUI active document resolution** — tools and `execute_code` now prefer `FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument.Document` over `App.ActiveDocument`, fixing desync when multiple documents are open. New `active_document.py` module with `resolve_active_document()` / `get_synced_active_document()`. (PR #3, @dpappo)
- **OpenAI GPT-5 support** — `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`, temperature omitted (GPT-5 rejects non-default values). Handled via `_apply_provider_overrides()`. (PR #3, @dpappo)
- **Sandbox document copy** — `execute_code` subprocess sandbox now opens a temp copy of the saved `.FCStd` file so `getObject()`-style code validates against real document state instead of an empty `SandboxTest` doc. (PR #3, @dpappo)

### Fixed

- **Assembly ViewProvider** — joints and grounded joints now get proper ViewProvider setup for GUI integration (icons, Simulation support).
- **OpenAI reasoning_content** — preserve `reasoning_content` field in message format for models that return chain-of-thought.
- **Dark mode for all widgets** — extended theme support to all UI widgets, not just chat. Added sandbox GUI stub for headless environments.

## [0.6.0-alpha] - 2026-03-28

New tools, Skills management, skill optimizer, hooks, and snap packaging fix.

### Added

- **Skill optimizer** — `/optimize-skill` command that iteratively improves SKILL.md files by running test cases, scoring results (completion, errors, geometric correctness, efficiency, visual similarity), and using the LLM to modify instructions. Includes PySide2 configuration dialog, version history with original backup, three optimization strategies (conservative, balanced, aggressive), and configurable network retry with exponential backoff. Inspired by [autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch).
- **Built-in skills auto-discovery** — SkillsRegistry now scans both the repo's `skills/` directory and the user's `~/.config/FreeCAD/FreeCADAI/skills/`. User skills override built-in skills with the same name. No more manual copying of built-in skills.
- **Hooks system** — user-defined Python hooks that fire on lifecycle events (`pre_tool_use`, `post_tool_use`, `user_prompt_submit`, `post_response`). Hooks can block actions, modify input, or log activity. Directory-based discovery at `~/.config/FreeCAD/FreeCADAI/hooks/`. Includes built-in `log-tool-calls` hook and Settings UI for managing hooks.
- **Configurable context window** — new "Context Window" setting controls when automatic conversation compaction triggers. Set to your model's context limit or lower to control API costs.
- **`describe_model` tool** — comprehensive geometry summary of an object in one call: bounding box, volume, face/edge counts, hollow/solid detection, estimated wall thickness, and PartDesign feature list.
- **`redo` tool** — redo previously undone operations.
- **`undo_history` tool** — show the undo/redo stack with named transactions, so the model can see what's available before deciding what to undo.
- **`undo` enhanced** — new `until` parameter to undo back to a named transaction (e.g., `until="Pocket"`). Returns what was undone and remaining undo/redo counts.
- **Fuzzy skill matching** — `use_skill` now does substring search on skill names and descriptions when the exact name isn't found.
- **Skills management in Settings** — new "Skills" section showing all installed skills with status indicators (built-in, modified, user). "Reset to Built-in" button reverts stale user copies to the repo version.
- **"Model supports tool calling" checkbox** — `enable_tools` config exposed in Settings UI. Uncheck for models that don't support tool calling.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — contributor guide with fork/clone setup, commit conventions, and how to add skills/providers/tools.

### Fixed

- **Snap-packaged FreeCAD SSL** — handle missing `_ssl` module gracefully. HTTP connections (Ollama) work without SSL; HTTPS gives a clear error suggesting Ollama.
- **Snap tabs default clearance** — changed from 0.2mm to 1.0mm so tabs have proper protrusion even when the model omits the parameter.
- **`describe_model` FreeCAD Quantity** — cast `Base.Quantity` to `float` before formatting.
- **Settings Test Connection crash** — removed leftover `prompt_style_combo` reference.

### Changed

- **`create_inner_ridge` simplified** — extracted `_add_rect` helper, 28 lines → 18 lines.
- **37 tools total** (was 34).

## [0.5.0-alpha] - 2026-03-27

Autonomous skill invocation and editable system prompt.

### Added

- **`use_skill` tool** — the model can now autonomously invoke skills when the user's request matches one. Instead of redirecting users to type `/enclosure`, the model calls `use_skill("enclosure", "120x80x60mm, screw lid")`, gets the step-by-step instructions, and executes them with tools. Natural language "create an enclosure" now works end-to-end.
- **Editable system prompt** — the full system prompt is now visible and editable in Settings, with a "Reset to Default" button. Users can customize the instructions sent to the LLM.

### Fixed

- **Enclosure skill screw geometry** — screw posts now start from the floor surface (offset=T) instead of z=0, and screw holes use fixed depth (H-T) instead of through_all so they don't exit through the bottom wall.
- **PROVIDER_PRESETS consolidation** — eliminated duplicated provider config between `config.py` and `providers.py`. Adding a new provider is now a single-file change.

### Changed

- **Skills no longer redirect** — the system prompt no longer tells the model to ask users to type slash commands. The model uses `use_skill` to load instructions and executes them directly.

## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2026-03-26

Multi-provider support and tool calling reliability.

### Added

- **16 new LLM providers** — DeepSeek, Qwen (DashScope), Groq, Mistral, Together AI, Fireworks AI, xAI (Grok), Cohere, SambaNova, MiniMax, Llama (Meta), GitHub Models, HuggingFace, Zhipu (GLM), Moonshot (Kimi). All OpenAI-compatible with tool calling support. Total: 22 providers + custom.
- **Dynamic API key resolution** — API keys support `file:/path/to/token` (re-read each call) and `cmd:command` (run command, use stdout) prefixes to avoid storing keys in plaintext.
- **Smart object name resolution** — `_get_object()` auto-resolves common LLM naming mistakes (`Sketch0`→`Sketch`, `Sketch1`→`Sketch001`, `Body1`→`Body001`). Error messages now list available objects via `_suggest_similar()` for LLM self-correction.

### Fixed

- **Streaming `finish_reason` handling** — tool calls no longer silently dropped when providers return `"stop"` instead of `"tool_calls"` as the finish reason.
- **`tool_choice="auto"` now explicit** — some providers (e.g. Moonshot/Kimi-K2.5) require this to be set explicitly or they ignore tools entirely. Now sent with every OpenAI-compatible tool-calling request.
- **`reasoning_content` preservation** — thinking models (e.g. Kimi-K2.5) that return `reasoning_content` in assistant messages now have it preserved across agentic loop turns. Without this, multi-turn tool chaining broke after the first turn.
- **Moonshot parameter constraints** — temperature, top_p, and penalty values are automatically overridden to Kimi-K2.5's required fixed values. Temperature field is greyed out in Settings when Moonshot is selected.
- **Non-streaming `stop_reason` detection** — now correctly sets `stop_reason="tool_use"` when tool calls are present regardless of the provider's `finish_reason` value.

### Changed

- **Snap tabs as PartDesign features** — `create_snap_tabs` now creates `PartDesign::AdditiveBox` features inside the lid body instead of a standalone `Part::Feature`. Tabs are individually editable and compatible with fillet, chamfer, pattern, and other PartDesign tools.
- **Better tool success messages** — `create_sketch`, `create_body`, `pad_sketch`, and `pocket_sketch` now include explicit naming hints (e.g., "Use sketch_name='Sketch001' in pad_sketch/pocket_sketch").

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-03-14

Vision routing, image support, user extension tools, and deferred MCP tool loading.

### Added

- **Vision routing** — automatically detect whether the LLM supports vision via a probe image during Test Connection. Vision-capable models receive images inline; non-vision models get images auto-described via an MCP `describe_image` tool (e.g., [llm-vision-mcp](https://github.com/ghbalf/llm-vision-mcp)). When no vision path exists, image controls (Capture, Attach, drag-drop, paste) are disabled. Includes a manual override checkbox in Settings.
- **Image support** — attach viewport screenshots and images to chat messages (Capture button, Attach button, drag-drop, paste)
- **User extension tools** — register custom Python functions (`.py` / `.FCMacro`) as LLM-callable tools. Functions with type hints are auto-discovered from `~/.config/FreeCAD/FreeCADAI/tools/`, validated via AST, and registered into the tool registry. Includes Settings UI for managing tools and optional FreeCAD macro directory scanning.
- **Deferred MCP tool loading** — tool schemas are loaded lazily on first use instead of eagerly on connect, configurable per-server via the `deferred` setting (default: `true`)
- **Tool search** — `MCPClient.search_tools()`, `MCPManager.search_tools()`, and `ToolRegistry.search_tools()` for keyword-based tool discovery across all registered tools
- **Lazy parameter resolution** — `ToolDefinition.lazy_params` callable and `resolve_params()` method for on-demand schema loading
- **Settings UI** — "Deferred tool loading" checkbox in the Add MCP Server dialog; server list shows `(deferred)` / `(disabled)` tags
- **24 new unit tests** for deferred loading, lazy params, tool search, and MCP manager integration

## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-02-24

PartDesign-native primitives, patterns, and multi-transform.

### Changed

- **`create_primitive` converted to PartDesign** — creates AdditiveBox, SubtractiveCylinder, etc. inside a Body instead of Part::Box/Part::Cylinder. Supports `operation="additive"|"subtractive"` and `body_name` for adding to existing bodies.
- **`create_wedge` converted to PartDesign** — now uses a loft-based approach instead of Part::Wedge
- **`shell_object` defaults to `reversed=True`** — inward shelling preserves outer dimensions (more intuitive default)
- **`multi_transform` accepts multiple features** — can chain linear pattern + polar pattern + mirror in one operation

### Added

- **`mirror_feature` tool** — mirror a PartDesign feature across XY, XZ, or YZ plane (`PartDesign::Mirrored`)
- **`multi_transform` tool** — chain multiple transformation patterns (linear, polar, mirror) in a single PartDesign::MultiTransform feature
- Integration tests for PartDesign `create_primitive` and `create_wedge`

### Fixed

- LLM stringified-list bug in `shell_object`, `fillet_edges`, `chamfer_edges` — handle `"['Face1']"` strings from some LLMs
- `multi_transform` visibility — ensure intermediate features are hidden after transform
- Added missing tools to system prompt strategy list and stop-when-done instruction
